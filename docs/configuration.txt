NagCat Configuration
========================

Basic
-----

The configuration file that defines tests uses the coil format. This
document assumes a working knowledge of coil but should still make sense
to someone new to the format. A basic test may look something like this:

foo-is-ok: {
    query: {
        type: "http"
        path: "/status"
        filters: [ "regex:^OK$" ]
    }

    documentation: "Check that foo reports its status as OK"
    investigation: [ "1. Check foo is up and running."
                     "2. Check foo can access database."
                     "3. Stumped? Escalate to next tier." ]
}

This defines a test named 'foo-is-ok'. This name will be used to
reference this test in the Nagios service definition or in NagCat's
command line arguments if trying things out in stand-alone mode.

The most important section is the 'query' section. It defines the
request to send to the service as well as any processing that needs to
be performed on the data received.

To be friendly to the people who may have to respond to alerts this test
generated documentation can be included inside the reports. The
'documentation' attribute will always be included in the report and
should note what exactly the results of the test mean. The
'investigation' attribute will only be included if the test status is
WARNING, CRITICAL, or UNKNOWN and should include some basic info on how
to diagnose and possibly fix the issue.

When this test runs it will do the following:

    1. Send a GET request to "http://<hostname>:<port>/status" where
       <hostname> and <port> are the host and port number defined by
       either Nagios or command line arguments. If this request fails
       abort the test and report CRITICAL.

    2. Filter the returned data, passing along only the first match of
       the regular expression. If it fails to match the expression abort
       the test and report CRITICAL.

    3. If nothing has failed so far then we must be good! Report OK.


Compound Queries and Thresholds
-------------------------------

Some more complex tests may need to get multiple pieces of data and 
compare them, there is no limit to the number of sub-queries in a compound
query. For example checking that a system is using today's data set or
that a client is in sync with its master. This can be accomplished using
the compound query which allows you define two sub-queries within one
query section. Note that only one level is allowed, a sub-query cannot
itself be another compound query. Here is an example:

foo-client-in-sync: {
    query: {
        type: "compound"

        master: {
            type: "http"
            host: "master-foo"
            port: 8080
            path: "/status/sequence_number"
            filters: [ "regex:\d+" ]
        }

        client: {
            type: "http"
            path: "/status/sequence_number"
            filters: [ "regex:\d+" ]
        }

        return: "master - client"
    }

    warning: ">100"
    critical: ">200"

    documentation: "Client must not differ by more than 100"
}

In this example we fetch a sequence number from both the master and
client, presumably representing the position of a data stream that the
master is sending out. The compound query itself has only two special
attributes: 'type' and 'return'. 'type' declares that it is a compound
query and 'return' defines how to combine the results, usually in some
sort of math expression.

The 'warning' and 'critical' attributes define a comparison with the
returned data to check, causing the test to report WARNING or CRITICAL
respectively. If neither comparison is true then it will report OK.

If a test requires a configuration or substitution that has no logical default
then you will want to specify it in nagios, where the remainder of the host,
port and other deployment specific configuration lives. In order to do this
you simply specify a parameter, preceeded by an underscore, that matches the
full coil path to the parameter you wish to override.

So, to replace foo-client-in-sync with a test that has no default port for the
master, a variable URI for the client, and a variable regex filter on the
client return value you might create the following nagcat test:
foo-client-in-sync: {
    query: {
        type: "compound"
        master: {
            type: "http"
            host: "somehostdc7"
            port: ""
            path: "/status/sequence_number"
            filters: [ "regex:\d+" ]
        }

        client: {
            type: "http"
            path: ""
            interestingvalue: ""
            filters: [ "regex:\d+" "regex:${interestingvalue}" ]
        }

        return: "master - client"
    }
    warning: ">100"
    critical: ">200"
}
Then in Nagios you would need to include these parameters in the test
declaration:
    _query.master.host                  somehostdc9
    _query.master.port                  1234
    host                                someclientdc9
    port                                9019
    _query.client.path                  /some/path
    _query.client.interestingvalue      foo.*bar


Format Details
--------------

Below is a full specification of the file format. All top level items in
the file are expected to be test definitions, each with a unique name.

Any structure attribute that is not defined here may be used for
anything which is useful for coil structure inheritance or in string
substitution.

Tests
~~~~~

Test names may be any valid coil identifier. The only attribute that is
strictly required is 'query' but 'documentation' and 'investigation'
should normally be included.

test-name: {
    query: {
        type: "<query type>"
        # All query structures must have a 'type' attribute. The
        # interpretation of the rest of the structure depends on the
        # type. See the Queries section for the details.
    }

    # 'label' is a optional user friendly name to describe the final
    # value. It is used in some errors and rrdtool trend graphs.
    label: "% Disk Used"

    # 'repeat' defines when or how frequently to run. It may be a
    # specific time of day or a time interval such as 10s or 10m.
    # The default is 1 minute.
    repeat: "1m"

    # Filters are strings defining some manipulation to the data
    # returned, they are run in the order listed.
    # Valid filters are:
    #   "regex:<some regular expression>"
    #       If the regular expression includes a grouping ie: (foo) the
    #       result will be the first grouping, otherwise it is the match
    #       of the entire expression.
    #
    #   "date2epoch:<date format>"
    #       Convert a date using the given format to a time in seconds
    #       since the epoch, useful for doing math with $(NOW).
    #
    #   "xpath:<some xpath expression>"
    #       If you are parsing XML, using XPath expressions are the way
    #       to go. Some quick examples:
    #       Get the HTML title:           /html/head/title/text()
    #       Get a div with a specific id: //div[@id="something"]
    #
    #       More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath_1.0
    #
    #   "save:<some name>"
    #       Saved the current result as the given name and will be
    #       included with that name in the 'Extra Output' section of the
    #       report.
    #
    #    "warning:<operator> <value>"
    #    "critical:<operator> <value>"
    #       The warning and critical filters simply test the data and
    #       raise a Warning or Critical alert if the test is true.
    #       Normally you will define these with the separate warning
    #       and critical attributes rather than in the filter chain for
    #       clarity but using them as filters allows more complex tests.
    #       See the description of warning/critical below for more info.
    filters: [ "somefilter:arguments" ]

    # 'warning' and 'critical' will compare the data returned by the
    # query with a given value. If it evaluates to true the test will
    # report WARNING or CRITICAL respectively, with CRITICAL winning out
    # over WARNING if both are true.
    #
    # Relational operators (< <= >= >) only work with numeric values.
    #
    # Equality operators (= == != <>) will compare the values as numbers
    # if possible, otherwise it will compare them as strings.
    # = is an alias for == and <> is an alias for !=
    #
    # Regular expressions can be checked with =~ and !~ and will check
    # that the query matches or doesn't match respectively. The regular
    # expression is matched in multiline mode and <value> is the raw 
    # pattern. Currently the match is case sensitive and you cannot
    # specifiy flags. For example to go critical unless the exact
    # string "ok" is returned you could write: critical: "!~ ^ok$"
    warning: "<operator> <value>"
    critical: "<operator> <value>"

    # The 'trend' block defines how to record and graph the data over
    # time using rrdtool. By the final state is always recorded but
    # if the data is numeric this can be used to record it as well.
    trend: {
        # 'type' defines the type of data. It can be any of the normal
        # rrdtool data source types:
        # 'gauge' records a plain value, such as temperature
        # 'counter' records the change in a counter, resets are auto-detected.
        # 'derive' also records the change in the value, but can be negative.
        # 'absolute' is a special counter that resets when read.
        # If the 'type' attribute is not given then only the final state
        # is recorded.
        type: 'gauge'

        # 'label' will appear in the graph legend to identify this
        # data. It will default to the test's label or 'Result'.
        label: "Awesome Data"

        # 'display' defines how to display the data, can be 'line'
        # or 'area'. Use 'area' if you want the various data souces
        # to stack on top of each other. Defaults to 'line'.
        display: "line"

        # 'color' defines a RGB color to use for the line or area.
        # A color will be chosen if not given.
        color: "#000000"

        # 'scale' defines what scale the returned data is. This can
        # be used to ensure the scale is correct if a query returns
        # a size in KB instead of Bytes. In this case set scale to
        # 1024. Defaults to 0.
        scale: 1024

        # 'base' defines what base the data is. This also helps ensure
        # the scale is correct. If a query is getting an amount of
        # memory set this to 1024 so one 'K' is 1024, one M is 1024K,
        # etc. The default is 1000 so on 'K' is 1000, one M is 1000K.
        base: 1024

        # 'title' defines a title to place at the top of the graph.
        title: "somehost - Pretty Graph"

        # axis_min/axis_max: default minimum and maximum scale for the
        # y axis. If any data is outside of this range the scale will
        # be expanded to include it. axis_min defaults to 0
        axis_min: 0
        axis_max: 99

        # axis_label provides a label for the y axis. This will
        # typically be the units of the data such as 'bytes'.
        # The default is no label
        axis_label: "bytes"
    }

    # 'documentation' and 'investigation' are used only for providing
    # in-line information in the generated reports. They can be either a
    # single string or a list of strings to represent multiple lines.
    documentation: "What does this test actually test?"

    # 'investigation' is only displayed when the status is not OK
    investigation: [ "The problem may be caused by this."
                     "Or it may be caused by that." ]

    # 'url' provides links to additional documentation.
    url: "http://something/amazing.html"

    # 'priority' is an arbitrary string that can be used to indicate
    # how urgent any reported problems are.
    priority: "FIXMENOW"
}

Queries
~~~~~~~

Compound:

query: {
    type: "compound"

    # At least one sub-query must be defined and may be any type except
    # for compound.
    # Sub-queries may have any name other than 'type' or 'return'
    sub-query-a: { }

    # All compound queries must define a return statement.
    # Values of the sub-queries are in the format $(query-name)
    #
    # Values operate both as strings and numbers depending on which
    # operator is used. The following operators expect a numeric
    # value and will cause the alert to go CRITICAL if it is not.
    #
    #       + - * / // % divmod() pow() ** neg() pos() abs()
    #
    #       < <= => >
    #
    # The == and != operators will do a numeric comparison if the two
    # values happen to be numbers, otherwise it will compare them as
    # strings.
    #
    # By default there is a variable called $(NOW) which is the current
    # time in seconds since the epoch. Useful in combination with the
    # date2epoch filter in a subquery.
    return: "<some expression>"
}

All other queries have the following in common:

query: {
    type: "???"

    # Override the host being tested
    host: "<host name>"

    # Override the port
    port: <port number>

    # Filters and warning/critical tests can be defined here just as
    # they are inside a test but will apply to only this query.
    filters: [ "somefilter:arguments" ]
    warning: "<operator> <value>"
    critical: "<operator> <value>"

    # 'trend' is the same as the trend block in the main test section
    # but will graph this specific query's data. All the same
    # attributes are supported except for axis_min, axis_max, axis_label.
    trend: { type: "gauge" }

    # 'repeat' may be defined here to override the repeat value for the
    # entire test. This is useful for having one sub-query in a compound
    # query run less frequently than the rest if it is an expensive
    # operation or its value only changes at a specific time of day.
    # The default is the parent test's repeat value.
    repeat: "1m"
}

HTTP:

query: {
    type: "http"
    # set type to "https" for SSL connections

    # Path to request with either a GET or a POST
    path: "/some/url/path"

    # Data to POST, if missing a GET is used instead.
    data: "some arbitrary data"

    # Extra request headers to send, must be a structure with
    # header-name: "value" pairs.
    headers: { Accept: "text/plain" }
}

Raw TCP/SSL:

query: {
    type: "tcp"
    # set type to "ssl" for SSL connections

    # Data to send. Be sure to include any newlines, etc.
    data: "some arbitrary data"
}

Subprocess:

query: {
    type: "subprocess"

    # Command to execute, can be a shell pipeline or whatever.
    command: "something to run"

    # Data to write to stdin
    data: "some arbitrary data"

    # Optionally you may add various environment variables.
    environment: {
        PATH: "/special/path:/usr/bin"
    }
}

SNMP: (versions 1 and 2 only currently)

query: {
    type: "snmp"

    # community name, required
    community: "public"

    # OID number, required
    oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"   # SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0

    # port number, defaults to 161
    port: "161"

    # SNMP version, 1 or 2c, defaults to 2c
    version: "2c"
}
