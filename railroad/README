        Railroad :: Graphing front-end for Nagcat/Nagios and RRDtool
    _______________________________________________________________________


Introduction

    Railroad is a web frontend for Nagcat which allows you to view graphs of
    live and historical trend data. This is done via the Nagcat coil
    configurations and the RRDs generated by Nagcat.

Dependencies

    Requirement         Version         Notes

    * python            >= 2.5          untested on earlier versions/3.x
    * apache            >= 2.0          requires wsgi support
    * django            >= 1.1
    * mod_wsgi
    * python-json

Installation
    
    To install railroad, follow the steps below:

    0. Make sure all of the dependencies are installed. They *will* break things.
       If you realize you didn't install something after following these
       instructions, make sure you restart apache when finished.

    1. Copy the source files to the directory of your choice (normally done as
       part of the Nagcat installation).

    2. Edit the configuration files. Samples are present in the samples directory.

    3. Copy your settings.py to <railroad path>/railroad/settings.py

    *** Skip steps 4-7 if you are not using Apache ***

    4. Navigate to your Apache configuration directory. In Fedora, this is
       /etc/httpd/conf.d

    5. There are two roads you could take here:
       
       * If you are doing development on the project, we suggest soft linking
         the railroad.conf file:

         ln -s <install path>/railroad.conf railroad.conf

       * If this is a long term install, we'd suggest cp'ing it:

         cp <install path>/railroad.conf railroad.conf

    6. Make sure you either have the following line in your apache config, or
       in a file in your conf.d (ie, wsgi.conf):

           LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so

       Also make sure the Apache configuration you loaded has the correct path
       to django.wsgi.

    7. ***Restart apache.***

    8. Open your favorite web browser and navigate to (assuming localhost):
       
       http://localhost/railroad/pagetest/

    9. Congratulations! You've installed railroad. If it seems broken, make sure
       you installed all dependencies. If you still have problems, contact the
       developers/maintainers included at the bottom of this document.
