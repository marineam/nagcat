NagCat README
=============

INTRODUCTION
------------

NagCat is a configuration based monitoring framework intended for use
with Nagios 3.x. NagCat uses tests defined in a coil configuration
file and runs them against hosts defined in Nagios, submitting results
as passive tests to Nagios. Each test run by NagCat translates to one
service defined in Nagios. This is a significant departure from the
normal mode of operation for Nagios which requires it to schedule and
run independent scripts (aka active checks) to check each service it is
monitoring.

The primary purpose of this approach is to ensure that adding more tests
for a service imposes a minimal impact. By running as a separate daemon
NagCat has the ability to group tests together that make the same
query to a service and run different checks against the return data. For
example you may want to write two tests that both query Apache's
server-status page, one test checks the number of threads working
threads, another checks the number of requests per second. These two
tests can be represented in Nagios as two different services and thus
can send out alerts independently. NagCat will automatically schedule
these two tests to run at the same time, running the two tests against
the data returned by a single request to Apache. For such a simple
example this may not be critical but it can be on a large and complex
system that requires many many different tests to ensure that it is
functioning properly.


FEATURES
--------

 * Smart scheduling to reduce the number of queries required.
 * Tests defined in a declarative config format, improving
   maintainability of tests by making them easy to read and avoiding the
   potential mess that may grow if they were all written as individual
   Nagios plugins.
 * Detailed reports with embedded documentation to give the person
   responding to an alert the info the need to investigate the issue
   even if they do not have extensive experience with the system.
 * Tests or sub-tests can be defined to run at different intervals.
 * Set different alert thresholds based on the time.
